# Firebase OAuth Domain Authorization Fix

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Explanation
The error "The current domain is not authorized for OAuth operations" occurs because your GitHub Pages domain `anilk-jsx.github.io` is not registered as an authorized domain in your Firebase project.

## üîß Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Go to Firebase Console
1. Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your **"trace-the-path"** project

### 2. Navigate to Authentication Settings
1. Click on **"Authentication"** in the left sidebar
2. Click on **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll down to **"Authorized domains"** section

### 3. Add Your Domain
Click **"Add domain"** and add these domains one by one:
- `anilk-jsx.github.io` (for GitHub Pages)
- `localhost` (for local development)
- `127.0.0.1` (alternative localhost)

### 4. Save Changes
Click **"Save"** after adding each domain.

## ‚úÖ What This Fixes
- Removes the OAuth domain error messages
- Allows Firebase authentication to work on GitHub Pages
- Enables proper functionality for all Firebase features

## üß™ Testing
After adding the domains:
1. Deploy your site to GitHub Pages
2. Visit `https://anilk-jsx.github.io/TRACE-THE-PATH/`
3. The OAuth error should be gone
4. All Firebase features should work normally

## üìù Additional Notes
- This is a one-time setup
- The error doesn't break functionality, just shows warning messages
- Local development on `localhost:8000` should also work after adding localhost to authorized domains

## üîç Verification
Open browser console and you should see:
- ‚úÖ "Firebase initialized successfully" instead of OAuth errors
- ‚úÖ No more iframe.js:310 errors
- ‚úÖ All authentication features working properly

*This fix has been implemented with error handling in your code, so the app will continue to work even before you add the domains to Firebase.*
